E-commerce Data Clustering and VisualizationThis project analyzes E-commerce data to segment customers based on transaction behaviors, demographics, and coupon usage using clustering techniques. The project aims to uncover customer patterns and visualize the clusters using various plots.FeaturesLoad and merge customer, transaction, gender, and city data.Preprocess data to extract transaction frequency and coupon usage metrics.Use K-Means clustering to segment customers into groups.Visualize clusters with interactive 3D and 2D scatter plots using Plotly.Evaluate clustering performance using the Elbow method and Silhouette score.UsageLoad Data: The code reads data from an Excel file named E-commerce_data.xlsx. Ensure the file is in the same directory as the script or provide the correct file path.Data Preparation:Load and inspect customer and transaction data.Merge gender and city information into the customer data.Extract key metrics: transaction frequency and coupon usage.Clustering:Apply K-Means clustering on the preprocessed data.Visualize clusters using 3D scatter plots and 2D scatter plots.Evaluation:Use the Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters.Calculate the Silhouette score to assess clustering quality.Visualization3D Scatter Plot: Visualize clusters with city, coupon usage, and transaction features.2D Scatter Plots: Show relationships between various features (e.g., city vs. coupon usage).Elbow Curve: Identify the optimal number of clusters for K-Means.Silhouette Score: Evaluate the clustering performance.ConclusionThe project provides insights into customer behavior by segmenting them into clusters, which can be valuable for targeted marketing and customer retention strategies.[?25l[28;18H(B[0;7m[ line  1/1 (100%), col  1/ 1 (100%), char  0/0 ( 0%) ](B[m[?12l[?25h[2d[?25l[28;73H[?12l[?25h[2d[?25l[28;73H[?12l[?25h[2d[?25l[28;73H[?12l[?25h[2d[?25l[28;73H[?12l[?25h[2d[?25l[?12l[?25h[30;1H[?1049l[23;0;0t[?1l>[?2004l
